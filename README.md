## Getting Started

To get started with Mk-forum, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line interface. Next, create an `.env` file following the `.env_template`. Once you have these prerequisites, you can clone the repository and run the server using the following command: `python manage.py runserver`.

This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000/`. You can then navigate to this URL in your web browser to access the forum.
